## AI as a tool
- AI accelerates scientific research.
  - Examples from the course in the past two years:
- How does AI help? 
  - Data analysis, simulation, routine automation, etc.

## AI as a collaborator
- Focus of this semester: AI accelerates mathematical research.
  - Core intellecture challenge
    - formulating hypothesis/definition
    - design algorithms
    - proving theorems
    - constructing counterexamples

## Course organization
- Passive in previous semester:
  - Students are assigned with published papers.
  - Present the existing results in the paper in the end of the semester
- Active in this semester:
  - Students are assigned with **open problems** with the __ambition__ to solve it!
  - If succeed, lead to technical report or even **publications**.
  - More to be covered later.
